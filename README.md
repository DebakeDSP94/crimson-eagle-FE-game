We're currently in the Project Planning Phase where we create a list of priority items (backlog items) in order to ensure we finish the sprint in roughly 36 to 48 hours before project end. On 8pm 05/17/2023 USA we will be in the sprint and will begin coding.

TO DO List:
```
1. find your name on trello under team members and add your username so we can start assigning tasks.
2. Finalize the front-end stack (React, Next, whatever, just pick one)
3. We should have a project plan by tomorrow night at 8pm est. After that, we should begin development.
4. Review Trello

```
Currently Doing
```
1. 
2. Determine if we should create prototypes with vanilla or go straight into react development?
3. Need a color palette
4. determine middleware tech (oauth?)
5. determine single-player or multi-player?
```
Done/Review (these be finalized by 8pm 05/17/2023 USA) unless recommendations/suggestions/concerns received
```
"create user, admin stories"
------> unless someone wants to add/remove the stories (what users/admin want to do on the site) or separate them into MVP and Done. I think this is something we can take off of our plate.
"back-end stack"
Defining MVP (html/css/js designed with accessibility in mind, state management, works with no accessibility)
Defining Done (plus user/admin roles, user/game statistics, custom game board/pieces, tournament creation, accessible)
"Paper Wireframing."
```
